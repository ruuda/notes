Notable snippets from Dijkstra's EWDs:

 * EWD667: On the foolishness of "natural language programming" ([html][ewd667], [pdf][ewd667p])

  > Machine code, with its absence of almost any form of redundancy, was soon
  > identified as a needlessly risky interface between man and machine. Partly
  > in response to this recognition so-called "high-level programming languages"
  > were developed, and, as time went by, we learned to a certain extent how to
  > enhance the protection against silly mistakes. It was a significant
  > improvement that now many a silly mistake did result in an error message
  > instead of in an erroneous answer. (And even this improvement wasn't
  > universally appreciated: some people found error messages they couldn't
  > ignore more annoying than wrong results, and, when judging the relative
  > merits of programming languages, some still seem to equate "the ease of
  > programming" with the ease of making undetected mistakes.)

 * EWD854: The Fruits of Misunderstanding ([html][ewd854], [pdf][ewd854p])

   > I think anthropomorphism is the worst of all. I have now seen programs
   > "trying to do things", "wanting to do things", "believing thing to be
   > true", "knowing things" etc. Don't be so naÃ¯ve as to believe that this
   > use of language is harmless.

   > Yet people talk about programming as if it were a production process and
   > measure "programmer productivity" in terms of "number of lines of code
   > produced". In so doing they book that number on the wrong side of the
   > ledger: we should always refer to "the number of lines of code spent".

 * EWD898: The threats to computing science ([html][ewd898], [pdf][ewd898p])

   > The Fathers of the field had been pretty confusing: John von Neumann
   > speculated about computers and the human brain in analogies sufficiently
   > wild to be worthy of a medieval thinker and Alan M. Turing thought about
   > criteria to settle the question of whether Machines Can Think, a question
   > of which we now know that it is about as relevant as the question of
   > whether Submarines Can Swim.
